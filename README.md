# Task

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.12.

# To start the project you will need:

1. Set 2 terminals - one for folder `task` and another in folder `server`
2. In folder `task` type in terminal `npm install`
3. In folder `server` with the second terminal type `npx json-server db.json`, to start the server
4. In project terminal you can start the project with `npm run start` or `ng serve`
   
From there Angular will generate <http://localhost:4200>, click it and view my project.
<br>
The server navigation is `http://localhost:3000/users`. You can do every CRUD operation.

# Functionality of server
The server that I'm using is from this site [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) ,
and helper site ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server](https://moduscreate.com/blog/how-to-mock-data-in-angular-applications/))
